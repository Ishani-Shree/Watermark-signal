# Decisions log

Format: date/hour, decision, alternative rejected, why.

- **Hour 0-2** — Provider isolated behind an interface (`PriceProvider`) with
  `yfinance` and `replay` implementations. Rejected: calling yfinance directly
  from route handlers. Why: yfinance is unofficial Yahoo scraping and gets
  rate-limited from datacenter IPs (Render); the demo must not depend on it
  working live.
- **Hour 0-2** — Symbol-scoped vs user-scoped schema split from the start
  (`symbols/snapshots/baselines/events` vs `users/watchlist_items/read_state`).
  Rejected: a single denormalized table per user. Why: detection work must be
  computed once per symbol regardless of watcher count, not once per user.
